Learning Materials and My own learning journey and experiances


the skills and knowledge necessary to implement and automate the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of machine learning models using the latest MLOps tools and frameworks. Today building machine learning models is not enough. To succeed as a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or DevOps professional, you need to understand how to take your models from development to production while ensuring scalability, reliability, and continuous monitoring. This is where MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) comes into play, combining the best practices of DevOps and ML model lifecycle management.

* Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers aiming to scale their ML models and automate deployments.
* DevOps professionals looking to integrate machine learning pipelines into production environments.
* Software Engineers transitioning into the MLOps domain.
* IT professionals interested in end-to-end deployment of machine learning models with real-world data science projects.
