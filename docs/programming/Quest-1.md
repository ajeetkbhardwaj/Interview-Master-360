# Quest-1 :

1. Explain how would you reverse an array in place.
   Inplace : without using extra space we modify the array to become reversed.
2. What is difference between array and linked list ?

- Key Difference : Data Organization, Memory management and Complexity Analysis.

3. Can you explain, when we should prefer to use array or linked lists ?

- Arrays : Need for direct or random access like LookUp Table, When data will remain unchanged most of the time but requires most of time to access the elements.
- Linked Lists : Frequent insertions and deletions are expected, especially in the middle. The exact size of the list isnâ€™t known in advance, and you want the memory to be used flexibly. The primary operations are sequential, such as iteration from the beginning to the end.
