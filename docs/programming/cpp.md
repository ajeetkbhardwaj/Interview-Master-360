Definition - How to define the following concepts in programming ?

1. Variables - They are names as placeholder for representing data
2. Data Types - a set of data with predefined values.
3. System Defined(Primitive) Data Types -
4. User Defined Data Types -
5. Data Structures - Mechanism for storing, organising, manipulating and processing data efficiently in computers.
6. Linear Data Strcutures - data elements are retrieved sequencially but it's not compulsory they should stored sequentially.
7. Nonlinear Data Structures - data element are stored and retrieved in a nonlinear order.
8. 


How data types reduces the coding efforts into the programming ?

How many types of data types are there in programming ?

What is Abstract Data Types ?

A process of problem solving through programming consists of data strcutres with supported operations.


Remarks

1. Number of bits allocated for each data types depends upon the programming, compiler and operating systems.
2. All primitive data types supports the basic operations like addition, multiplication and substraction etc. similarly for user defined data types we needed to implement what are the operations it will supports.
