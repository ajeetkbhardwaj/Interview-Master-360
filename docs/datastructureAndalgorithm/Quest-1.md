# Quest-1 :

What is DSA ?

> DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms, where  Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while  Algorithms focus on processing this data. 
> Examples : Array, Linked List, Tree, Heap etc and  Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort etc Data Structure and Algorithm resp.

Why we have to learn DSA ?
- Industry Relevance: Most technical interviews for programming roles and software engineering rely heavily on DSA knowledge because it demonstrates practical problem-solving skills.
- Foundation for Advanced Topics: Mastery of DSA is foundational for areas like databases, operating systems, machine learning, and more advanced computer science subjects.
- Efficient Problem Solving: Learning DSA enables one to solve complex problems efficiently by choosing the best ways to organize and process data.
- Scalability: Proper use of DSA is critical as data volumes grow, ensuring software remains responsive and scalable for millions or billions of data items.
- Optimized Code: Understanding DSA leads to programs that run faster and use less memory since choosing the right structure and algorithm greatly impacts performance.
