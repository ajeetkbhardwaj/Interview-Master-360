# popper : Cyclic Data Processing


### Cyclic dataflow systems

* Iterative data processing: solving graph problems with iterative data processing, driver-based iterations vs native iterations with cyclic dataflows, changes for creating consistent checkpoints.
* Introduction to ML workflows: error handling and correction as a first class citizen, Reactive dataflow with deletes, edits, and appends.
* Backward and forward lineage for backward tracing and delete propagation, stage planning with incremental/non-incremental, monotonic/non-monotonic operators
* Lab: Hands-on exercises with Popper.
